      </div>

      <p>We are working with the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to enable access to de-identified individual level data for research.</p>

      <p>For most applications, Department for Education (DfE) data will now be provided though the <a href="">ONS Secure Research Service</a>.</p>

      <p>Access to the Secure Research Service may not be suitable if your request meets one or more of the following conditions:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Data is being processed to fulfil an essential public task (the data used is essential to run education and children’s services)</li>
        <li>You’re doing research funded by, commissioned by, or contracted to the DfE or other government departments and the Secure Research Service is not suitable</li>
        <li>You have approval from DfE before 1 June 2018, with agreement you would receive an extract, and the Secure Research Service is not suitable</li>
        <li>You want to re-use data already held by your requesting organisation and within the existing licence period</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If any of these apply, you should contact <a href="mailto:data.sharing@education.gov.uk">data.sharing@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="applications-made-before-1-may-2018">Applications made before 1 May 2018</h2>

      <p>Any application received before 1 May 2018 is being processed and we will contact you. You do not need to re-apply.</p>

      <p>If you submitted an application after this date, unless we have contacted you to treat your case as an exception, you need to submit a new application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="apply-for-access-to-dfe-data">Apply for access to <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> data</h2>

      <p>Before applying for education data using the Secure Research Service, you must have a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/basic-checks">basic disclosure certificate</a> that is no more than 2 years old.</p>

      <p>Anyone who needs to access the Secure Research Service will also need to be accredited under the <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/approvedresearcherscheme"><abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> approved researcher</a> scheme. We recommend that you begin this process as soon as possible and take steps to become accredited by <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> in parallel to your application. Contact <a href="mailto:research.support@ons.gov.uk">research.support@ons.gov.uk</a> with any questions.</p>

      <p>When you are ready to make an application, please contact <a href="mailto:data.sharing@education.gov.uk">data.sharing@education.gov.uk</a> and we’ll:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>send you an application form and guidance to complete it – including the new  method for classifying data identification risk and sensitivity levels</li>
        <li>let you know what data is available and the best way to access it</li>
        <li>help you through the Data Sharing Approval Panel (<abbr title="Data Sharing Approval Panel">DSAP</abbr>) approval process</li>
        <li>provide the final agreement and declaration for you to sign</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We maintain strict governance checks around the legality, proportionality, public benefit and security of requests.</p>

      <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="govuk-inset-text application-notice info-notice">
        <p>All applications must be made on the <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> application form available from <a href="mailto:data.sharing@education.gov.uk">data.sharing@education.gov.uk</a>. This includes requests for extracts from the National Pupil Database (<abbr title="National Pupil Database">NPD</abbr>), and matching <abbr title="National Pupil Database">NPD</abbr> extracts to other sources.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="accessing-the-data-using-the-secure-research-service">Accessing the data using the Secure Research Service</h2>

      <p>Once you are an <a rel="external" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/whatwedo/statistics/requestingstatistics/approvedresearcherscheme"><abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> approved researcher</a> and your data application has been approved, there are 2 ways you can access <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> data for approved projects through the Secure Research Service. You can use:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>physical labs – you can book a session to access <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> data at 1 of 5 <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> locations across the UK</li>
        <li>remote access – once your organisation meets security standards and have organised connectivity with <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr>, you can access data online using your own equipment subject to specified conditions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We’re aware some users are experiencing connectivity and performance issues with the Secure Research Service. We will consider contingencies such as the use of physical labs, temporary loan of <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> laptops, or short-term physical transfer of data.</p>

      <p>Contact us for details on getting approved remote access, or to report technical problems and get additional support: <a href="mailto:research.support@ons.gov.uk">research.support@ons.gov.uk</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" id="bespoke-extracts">Bespoke extracts</h3>

      <p>If your project requires more data than is available in the <abbr title="National Pupil Database">NPD</abbr> standard extracts, you can apply for a bespoke data extract. Bespoke data requests take longer than the standard extracts to create and approve.</p>

      <p>Bespoke linked <abbr title="National Pupil Database">NPD</abbr> and <abbr title="Higher Education Statistics Agency">HESA</abbr> data will be available to access through the <abbr title="Office for National Statistics">ONS</abbr> Secure Research Service soon and we will update this page when this is available.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="future-developments">Future developments</h2>

      <p>We are continuing to improve the ways you can access <abbr title="Department for Education">DfE</abbr> data. Planned future developments include:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>an online application process</li>
        <li>more readily available standard extracts, based on the most requested data</li>
        <li>publicly available synthetic data to help test and plan research</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For more information on future developments, please contact <a href="mailto:data.sharing@education.gov.uk">data.sharing@education.gov.uk</a>.</p>
